## 📌 Project Overview

This project allows users to analyze text from platforms such as Twitter and Reddit and generate sentiment predictions in real time.  
Users can select from multiple trained classical machine learning models and compare predictions using the same input text.

The system is designed to be fully reproducible and portable using Docker, so it can be run on any machine without manual dependency setup.
